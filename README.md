# ADVENTURE-WORKS-DE-PROJECT

OVERVIEW

Azure Data Factory: Extracted and loaded Adventure Works data from a GitHub repository into the Bronze layer of an Azure Data Lake.

Azure Databricks & PySpark: Transformed raw data in the Bronze layer and stored the processed data in the Silver layer.

Azure Synapse Analytics: Performed advanced transformations and modeled the data as tables in the Gold layer for analytics-ready insights.

Power BI: Visualized data with interactive dashboards for actionable business intelligence.

Key Highlights:

Efficiently implemented a multi-layered data lake architecture (Bronze, Silver, Gold). Leveraged Databricks for scalable data processing with PySpark. Used Azure Synapse Analytics for high-performance data warehousing. Designed intuitive dashboards in Power BI to unlock business insights. This project has been an exciting learning experience in data transformation, pipeline and visualization. Iâ€™m looking forward to tackling more challenging projects and expanding my expertise in cloud data engineering.
